This project and .rmd is a sham file to try to test if I can get an existing project into Github. I will first create a repo in git hub and then follow steps outlined in https://happygitwithr.com/existing-github-first.html in Chapter 16.

#Note: be sure the project options in this project have a Git repo set to 'None'
```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

this has been added from my original existing project
